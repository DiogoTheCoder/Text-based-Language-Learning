# Text-based-Language-Learning
The TBFLL_2 code adapts a text editor by "DiogoTheCoder" (Youtube name) for Text-based Language Learning and Testing.
The other Python programs and text files I must find a way to incorporate into the TBFLL_2, which is the GUI.
If you run the test_ files a scores.txt file is created which shows how well you did in the test.

# Text-based-Language-Learning
The TBFLL_2 code (the GUI) adapts a text editor by "DiogoTheCoder" (Youtube name) for a Text-based Language Learning and Testing tool that I aspire to create if I ever manage to get over the encoding problem. To make this GUI functional I will have to incorporate the Python
programs and text files you can find included in this repository.
If you run the test_ files, a scores.txt file is created which shows how well you did in the test.
